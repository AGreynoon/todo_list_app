# Todo List App - `feature/provider`

This branch demonstrates the implementation of state management using Provider in the To-Do List App.

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to refactor the app by replacing StatefulWidget with Provider for state management. This change enhances scalability, code maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Key Features
- Provider-based State Management: Centralized state management for tasks.
- Refactored File Structure: Organized codebase for better scalability.
- Improved Readability and Maintenance: Logic separated from UI components.
- Fully functional Add, Edit, and Delete task features.

## Known Limitations
- Tasks are not persisted; data will be lost upon app closure.
- Additional testing is needed to ensure all edge cases are handled.

## Installation:
Follow the same installation steps as the `main` branch.

## Usage:
1. Switch to this branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/provider
