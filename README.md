# Todo List App - `feature/statefulwidget`

This branch demonstrates the implementation of state management using **StatefulWidget** in the To-Do List App.

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to implement task management using Flutter's `StatefulWidget` before transitioning to more advanced state management solutions.

## Key Features
- Tasks stored as a `List` in the widget state.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks functionality.
- Navigation between Home, Add Task, and Edit Task screens.

## Known Limitations
- Tasks are not persisted; data is lost upon app closure.
- Difficult to scale for more complex applications.

## Installation:
Follow the same installation steps as the `main` branch.

## Usage:
1. Switch to this branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/statefulwidget
