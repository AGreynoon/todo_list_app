## General info
This is my first Flutter project, which I fully built without any help from any tutorial!!

At this point, I'm implementing everything I have learned in this journey. 

## Design info
I found this free simple design in Figma community ![LOW CODE TODO LIST APP AESTHETIC](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1301223631360583764) via **gorogurax**, then I have implemented it using Flutter framework.
